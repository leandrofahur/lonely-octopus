In the upcoming years they will need to carry out different field studies and analyses that impact hundreds of farmers. For example, they might decide to sponsor only one mode of irrigation and provide improved seeds for some selected crops. It is very costly to conduct an exhaustive census at different points in the development plan, which is where we need your help.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an Analyst in the Department of Strategy and Statistics, you have to decide which method do we use to sample farmers. This is very important because the method you decide to use will be implemented multiple times by the data collection team whenever they're on the field and we need to capture the whole agricultural situation of the concerned region.\n",
